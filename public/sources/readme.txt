*Everything is kept simple so you should not have any problems implementing the template. I will try to answer few of the possible questions below.*

**Changing logo**

There are two versions of logo used in the template - full logo `logo.png, 187px x 47px` used on higher resolution devices and small logo `logo-small.png, 110px x 47px` used on mobile phones only. When changing the logo please respect the height of the image (i.e. it should have 47px). Some testing and maybe also adjustments in the css would be needed if you use logo of radically different proportions than the one used in the template. 


**Changing the colour of the theme**

Every colour variant has its appropriate stylesheets located in the /css directory. To change the colour of the template simply change the path in the header of the HTML template, i.e. from `style.default.css` to `style.pink.css`.

**Javascript**

Apart from Bootstrap JS components majority of JS is located in /js/front.js. In this file you can change the settings of the owl carousel, product detail image switch etc. 

**Google Maps**

Google maps are used on the contact page. If you need just to show location of the company on the map, the only neccessary thing is to change coordinates in the `gmaps.init.js`. For further settings and possibilities please consult [gmaps.js documentation](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/) or [Google Maps API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).

Thank you for purchasing!

Ondrej, Bootstrapious
